## EDN TO END TESTING

### IOS SET UP

- To run the e2e tests you will need to install expo-cli on your machine by running the following command

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

- Next, we need to download a built version of the Expo iOS app that Detox can use to hook into. Go to the Expo Tools page and click the [Download IPA](https://expo.io/tools#client) link. Expand the downloaded archive, then change the name of the folder to “Exponent.app”. Create a bin folder in your project and move “Exponent.app” into it.

### ANDROID SET UP
